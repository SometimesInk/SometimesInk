## Me.
Hi there,
I am a French guy who codes stuff.

## "Codes stuff" is imprecise
I [think I] know Java, currently learning C, experienced with programming in general.

## Facts?
 - I'm a maths nerd,
 - Loves auroræ (and supernovæ [definitly not because of that U+00E6 character])

## More facts?
No thanks.

Bye bye :)
