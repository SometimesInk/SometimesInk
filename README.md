## Me.
Hai there!<br>
I am a French guy who codes stuff.

## "Codes stuff" is imprecise
I [think I] know Java, currently learning C, experienced with programming in general.

## Facts?
 - Maths nerd
 - Loves auroræ (and supernovæ [definitly not because of that U+00E6 character])
 - Apparently a masochist [because I code in Shell]

## More facts?
No thanks.

Bye bye :)
